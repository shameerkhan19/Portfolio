    <p class="info">My name is Shameer Khan. I am currently a student in Queens College CUNY pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in mathematics.
      I am proficient such languages as C++, Java, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, JSON, Ajax, Node.js, postgresSQL. I am currently seeking an
      entry level position as a software engineer.
     </p>
     <p class="info">My current Area of interest in machine learning, Data Analytics, and web development. I have performed research on certain machine learning techniques
      such as k-means clustering on 7-8 dimensional dataset, implementing a neural network to reduce error on machine perofmance via linear regression. I have worked on
      a open souce facial recognition from openCV. I am curerntly also looking into doing a semester long reserach on bayesian learning with lots of parameters.
     </p>
     <p class="info">
       As for Data analytics while working on my projects for machine learning I have worked with large set of data. And example of analyzing data in a clever way
       is to when creating the k-means cluster it is important to understand your data. Since this is an unsupervised learning method we have to pick our k-centers
       in such a way that proper clustering can happen. Which we can test each time by optimizing K with (EV/IV). Another example would be while implementing the neural
       network it also crucial to understand your data on how to properly dividing it up in k-fold validation. Leaving atleast one fold for cross validation and one fold
       for testing data. While keeping atmost k-2 fold for training the model.
     </p>
     <p class="info">
      As for web development I have done some front end and backend work. I have trained on HTML, CSS for frontend tasks. And trained on Javascript and ruby rails
      for backend work.
